Crowdfunding Analysis

This project analyzes a table containing a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects. 

I used formulas and conditional forrmatting as well as pivot tables to analyze the data. 

I created vizualizations based on the pivot table data using the inbuilt Exel table feature.
